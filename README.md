# Integrated-Approach-for-Pneumonia-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Overview
This repository contains the code for a pneumonia detection system built using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which was annotated and preprocessed before training a model. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the model's performance. The trained model is based on the pre-trained VGG16 architecture.

Features
Annotated and preprocessed dataset
Data augmentation techniques applied
Model trained using pre-trained VGG16
Web-based user interface built with Flask

Running the System
Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Flask application using python app.py.
Access the web interface in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
Input pneumonia symptoms and upload chest X-rays to receive results.

Model
The model architecture is based on the VGG16 convolutional neural network, pre-trained on ImageNet. Fine-tuning was performed to adapt the model to the pneumonia detection task.
